\begin{abstract}
The Emotional Resonance Mapping (ERM) Hypothesis posits that an individual’s unconscious cognitive processes and their contemporaneous affective states exhibit a significant degree of mutual resonance. This dynamic interplay is hypothesized to be sufficiently robust—particularly during heightened emotional episodes—to permit bidirectional or correlative mapping between subconscious ideation and real-time emotional valence. The theoretical foundation of this hypothesis is supported by emerging empirical findings within affective neuroscience and psychodynamic research.

In the present study, we undertake a systematic examination of the ERM framework and elucidate its integrative connections with the domains of traumatology, psychotraumatology, and contemporary dream theory. We aim to demonstrate how ERM not only aligns with established trauma models but may also offer novel insights into the encoding and manifestation of unresolved psychological conflict in both waking cognition and dream content.
