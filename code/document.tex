\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The \textbf{Emotional Resonance Mapping} hypothesis formalizes the belief that \emph{uncontrolled or subconscious thoughts are directed by real-time emotional states.}
Such thought-patterns are often observed in altered states of consciousness or in mid-REM stages when the brain is typically dreaming.
The ERM Hypothesis can be a useful formalization in the Traumatology and psychotraumatology.
